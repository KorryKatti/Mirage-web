# Guide for Designing a Custom Web-Based Client for Mirage Server

This documentation is intended for developers looking to create a custom web-based client that interacts with the Mirage server. Below are key tips, considerations, and best practices to ensure a smooth development process.

## 1. Understand the Server Architecture

Familiarize yourself with the server's functionality and how it operates:
- **Socket.IO**: The server uses Socket.IO for real-time communication. Understand how to establish a connection and listen for events.
- **Endpoints**: Review the various Socket.IO events implemented on the server (like `connect`, `disconnect`, `send_message`, etc.) to know how your client should communicate with the server.

## 2. Establish a Connection

Create a connection to the server when your client initializes:
- Use the appropriate Socket.IO client library for your chosen front-end framework (like React, Vue, or plain JavaScript).
- Ensure you handle the connection events to manage the connection lifecycle (on connect, disconnect, and errors).

## 3. Handle User Authentication and Data Storage

- **User Information**: Make sure to retrieve and manage user information effectively. This can be done through user inputs or a user profile.
- **Local Storage**: Consider using local storage to save user preferences and messages. This way, users can have a seamless experience, even when the server is restarted.

## 4. Implement Room Management

Create an intuitive user interface for room management:
- **Create Room**: Provide a UI element for users to create new rooms, ensuring to validate inputs (room name and username).
- **Join/Leave Room**: Create a simple mechanism to join or leave rooms. Reflect these changes in the UI in real-time using Socket.IO events.

## 5. Message Handling

Design the messaging functionality carefully:
- **Sending Messages**: Implement a messaging input box for users to send messages to a room. Include error handling for empty messages or missing data.
- **Receiving Messages**: Set up listeners for incoming messages to update the chat interface in real-time. Consider implementing message IDs for efficient message tracking.
- **Display Messages**: Design a clean layout to display messages, including timestamps and sender names. Ensure that the UI is user-friendly and visually appealing.

## 6. User List Management

Display a list of users in the room:
- Use the `get_users_in_room_route` event to fetch and display the list of users currently in the room.
- Update the user list in real-time as users join or leave.

## 7. Display Metrics

Consider adding a section in the UI to display server metrics:
- Use the `get_metrics` event to fetch and present server statistics such as total pings and today's pings. This can help users understand server performance.

## 8. User Experience Considerations

- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Provide visual feedback for user actions (like room creation, message sent, etc.) using notifications or toast messages.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the web client is responsive, so it looks good on various devices, including desktops and mobile devices.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to inform users of any issues (like trying to create a room that already exists).

## 9. Testing and Debugging

- Regularly test your client for bugs and usability issues. Use debugging tools available in browsers to track down issues.
- Consider testing the client with multiple users to see how it handles concurrent connections.

## Conclusion

By following this guide, you will create a web-based client that enhances user experience while interacting with the Mirage server. Always remember to iterate on feedback and improve the client based on user needs and preferences. Happy coding!
